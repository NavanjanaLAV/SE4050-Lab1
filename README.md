## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my solutions for **Lab Exercise 1** of SE4050 – Deep Learning.  
The lab focuses on learning and applying Python libraries commonly used in deep learning:
- **NumPy** for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** for plotting and visualization
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Seaborn** for statistical data visualization

## 🗂 Contents
- `Lab1.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with all Task 1 & Task 2 solutions
- `Au_nanoparticle_dataset.csv` → Dataset used for Task 2 (not uploaded if dataset is restricted)
- `README.md` → This file, describing the project

## 📝 Tasks Completed
### **Task 1**
1. Create a 4×4 array from an exponential distribution.
2. Create a large random array and visualize exponential, uniform, and normal distributions.
3. 3D plot for \( Z = X^2 + Y^2 \).
4. Pearson & Spearman correlation heatmaps for selected features.

### **Task 2**
1. Load `Au_nanoparticle_dataset.csv` as a DataFrame.
2. Filter specific columns and display first 20 samples.
3. Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, std, quartiles).
4. Plot histograms for each feature in a 1×4 layout.
5. Visualize using Seaborn pairplot.
6. Customize Seaborn PairGrid with histograms, KDE plots.

## ▶ How to Run
1. Open **Google Colab**: [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload `Lab1.ipynb`.
3. Upload the dataset (`Au_nanoparticle_dataset.csv`) or mount Google Drive to access it.
4. Run each cell sequentially.

## 📌 Notes
- Dataset links are provided in the lab sheet.
- Code is compatible with Python 3.10+.
- All visualizations are generated using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
